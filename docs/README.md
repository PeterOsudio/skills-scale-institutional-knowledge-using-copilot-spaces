# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Overview

This README is your starting point for understanding how OctoAcme teams plan, execute, release, and continuously improve projects. OctoAcme's approach centers on a structured lifecycle—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective—supported by role clarity, iterative development, and transparent communication. Key artifacts like the Project One-pager, prioritized backlogs, risk registers, and explicit checklists ensure projects remain goal-oriented and actionable throughout their lifespans.

**Key Workflows & Roles:**  
The project lifecycle begins with Initiation: the team identifies the business need, gathers stakeholders, defines success metrics, and produces an initial project charter. In Planning, the team breaks work into prioritized increments, maps dependencies, establishes a release plan, and defines the acceptance criteria. Execution is driven by daily standups, project boards, code reviews, automated and manual QA, and a clear escalation path for blockers. Releases follow standardized checklists, including backup plans and post-deploy verification, while Retrospectives help the team capture learnings and drive continuous process improvement.

**Personas & Communication:**  
Roles are well-defined to ensure clear ownership and accountability: the Project Manager coordinates delivery, risks, and communication; the Product Manager owns outcomes and backlog prioritization; Developers deliver features, tests, and documentation; the Release Manager orchestrates deployments and ensures release quality; DevOps Engineers maintain infrastructure and deployment pipelines; the QA Lead ensures testing standards and quality gates; UX Designers create user-centered experiences; and the Stakeholder Liaison manages external communications and feedback. Communication is structured via daily standups, weekly or twice-weekly delivery syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and established templates for reporting and escalation.

**Quality Assurance:**  
Quality is built in at every phase, including unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke testing, security scans, and clear acceptance criteria. A strong emphasis on retrospectives and risk management ensures that feedback loops remain tight and improvements are institutionalized.
